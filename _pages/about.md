I'm a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, supervised by [Prof. Georg Martius](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=b-JF-UIAAAAJ&hl=de). My research focuses on curiosity and intrinsically-motivated Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

Taking inspiration from developmental psychology, I'm developing methods to help robots explore their environment efficiently without extrinsic rewards, similar to how children perform free play.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de). My specialization was in Robotics and Automation. During my studies, I worked on various machine learning projects spanning diverse fields such as robotics, signal processing, communications and neuroscience.
